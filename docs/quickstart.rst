Get started
-----------


To get history from all installed browsers:
::

    from browser_history import get_history

    outputs = get_history()

    his = outputs.get()

- ``his`` is a list of ``(datetime.datetime, url)`` tuples.


If you want history from a specific browser:
::

    from browser_history.browsers import Firefox

    f = Firefox()

    his = f.fetch().get()

- ``Firefox`` in the above snippet can be replaced with any of the :ref:`supported_browsers`.
- ``his`` is a list of ``(datetime.datetime, url)`` tuples.

Command Line
------------

Running ``browser-history`` in shell/terminal/command prompt will return history from all
browsers with each line in the output containing the timestamp and URL separated by a comma.

To get history from a specific browser::

    browser-history -b Firefox
